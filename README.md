### Principles of Orion

- **Speed**. Orion was build to speed up the process of making administrable
web pages.

- **Simplicity**. The api will always be easy to use, everything will be 
magic, just like meteor.

- **Unobtrusive**. You will always be able to use the full power of meteor:
install extensions, use the templates system and everything else.

- **Scalable**. Orion it's built for the cloud. It doesn't write files, 
so you can deploy on anywhere.
